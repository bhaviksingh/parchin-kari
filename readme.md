# parchin kari
is a generative system inspired by L-Systems, and marble inlay art found in Sikh Gurudwaras (temples), which is known as "parchin kari". 

# overview
The algorithm for generating the flowers is separated from the renderer, to be able to play with a variety of rendering styles. 


# todo
1. Revamp the algo to work with classes, current system is too confusing
2. Revamp docs just to get a better handle on the algorithm
3. Improve flower collision detection (flowers should )
4. Why arent grids working with multiple plants ?? this is odd. classes might fix it.
